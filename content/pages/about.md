I am currently attending classes at University of Information Technology, Myanmar.

And I have a little bit of web development knowledge so I built this site.

I can type about 50 words per minute, and I like to listen LAUV songs on the bus.

Elon Musk is my role model.

I like cats and I usually pretend to love big dogs even though I am so much afraid of them.

I hate to use chat abbreviations like LOL, BTW, & I don't like emojis either.

BTW, I've seen two TESLA in real life, and I ❤️ them a lot.
